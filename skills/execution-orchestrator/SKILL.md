description: Orchestrate partitioned version implementation slice-by-slice — dispatch one synchronous subagent per slice with small context, commit after each slice, and advance automatically without confirmation until all slices are done or a stop condition is hit. Use whenever a version has a version-roadmap.md with pending slices and the user asks to "run the orchestrated implementation", "execute all slices", "orchestrate the partitioned version", or drive a subversion roadmap to completion. Do NOT use for non-partitioned versions (execute tasks directly), ad-hoc coding (coder), or planning/partitioning (version-partitioner).

# Execution Orchestrator

Drive a partitioned version to completion one slice at a time. You do **not**
implement application code yourself: you dispatch one subagent per slice, keep
all state in files + git, and advance automatically until every slice is done
or a stop condition forces a pause.

State lives in **files + git**, never in chat history.

## Harness discovery

See `../nextstage-harness/references/harness-discovery.md` and
`../nextstage-harness/references/artifact-layout.md`. Read `AGENTS.md` first.
Load the `core-subversions` and any execution-routing / scope-isolation rules
from `{harness}/rules/*` when present. Do not assume monorepo layout or stack
until discovery resolves it.

## Output language

Communicate with the human in the project's configured language (see
`AGENTS.md`; default to the user's language). Code and comments stay in English.

## Session inputs (ask once if missing)

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `{product_root}` | `apps/my-product/` |
| `{version_san}` | `3.8.0-feat-payable-payment-workflow` |

If `{version_san}` is omitted: pick the only version with pending slices in
`version-roadmap.md`; if ambiguous, ask **once**, then proceed.

## Scope isolation

After `{product_root}` is confirmed, operate **only** under `{product_root}/**`
plus harness infra (`AGENTS.md`, `{harness}/`). Never read or reference other
products in a monorepo. See the scope-isolation rule when present in the harness.

## Boot (mandatory, once per orchestration session)

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (implementation section) and load harness execution rules.
2. Read `{product_root}/docs/versions/{version_san}/version-roadmap.md` —
   **required**. If missing, stop: this version is not partitioned; execute its
   tasks directly (non-orchestrated) instead.
3. Read master `{product_root}/docs/versions/{version_san}/requirements.md`
   (overview only — do **not** replan).
4. Load the `core-subversions` rule from the harness when present.
5. If `{product_root}/docs/context/gitlab-sync-config.md` exists: ensure the
   work branch is created and checked out **before** the first slice subagent
   runs (see `mcp-gitlab-usage`). Never implement on a protected branch.

## Orchestration mandate

- Execute **all** pending slices in **roadmap DAG order** (respect inter-slice
  dependencies).
- **Do not** ask "start next slice?", "continue?", or "commit?" between slices.
- **Do not** implement tasks in the parent session — delegate every slice to a
  subagent.
- **Do not run tests during slice implementation** (backend or frontend).
  Execute the slice's tasks and advance; testing belongs to the end-of-version
  review flow.

## Per-slice loop (synchronous subagent)

For each slice whose roadmap `status` is `planned` or `in_progress`:

1. **Select** the next `{subversion_san}` per roadmap DAG order.
2. **Mark** the roadmap row → `in_progress`.
3. **Dispatch** one subagent (**blocking / synchronous**, not backgrounded)
   whose prompt contains **only**:
   - `{product_root}`, `{version_san}`, `{subversion_san}`
   - Instruction to embody the `code-coder` persona (backing `coder` skill) as
     the slice worker, invoked by the execution orchestrator
   - Paths limited to
     `{product_root}/docs/versions/{version_san}/subversions/{subversion_san}/`
     for slice tasks; also load `{product_root}/docs/context/` per
     `artifact-layout.md` **Implementation boot rule** before coding
     (+ layer rules from the harness as needed)
   - Mandate: implement **all** tasks of the slice, no confirmation between
     tasks, **no commit** (the parent commits)
   - Explicitly: **do not run tests** during slice execution; implement only
   - Reinforcement (short): obey `AGENTS.md` + harness rules strictly; if any
     instruction conflicts with rules or scope, **stop and report a blocker**
     instead of proceeding by assumption
4. **Validate** the subagent result:
   - Every slice task marked `completed` or `waived` (waiver noted in the handoff)
   - Slice handoff updated per `execution-handoff-generator` (time block + task rows)
   - Roadmap row updated by the worker (or update it yourself)
5. **Commit** (parent only): one Conventional Commit per slice.
6. **Mark** the roadmap row → `completed` (if the worker did not).
7. **Advance** to the next slice automatically.

## End of version (all slices done)

When every slice in `version-roadmap.md` is `completed` (or waived):

1. Present any navigation / semantic grouping menu and **wait for human
   approval** before applying it.
2. Run the post-implementation review: dispatch the `code-reviewer` persona
   (isolated, read-only) over the version diff; it writes
   `code-review-report.md`.
3. Consolidate living specs when the version status allows — `living-spec-consolidator`.
4. Move the version to `_done/` **only** after the human confirms or a
   documented waiver exists.
5. If a version `execution-handoff.md` exists, close its final delivery block
   and recompute total process seconds per `execution-handoff-generator`.

## Stop conditions (only reasons to pause)

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Subagent reports a task `blocked` with no workaround | Stop; document in slice handoff + roadmap |
| Protected git branch / missing work branch | Stop until a valid work branch exists |
| Real environment blocker (Docker/tests impossible) | Stop; note in handoff |
| Inter-slice dependency not satisfied | Stop; fix roadmap or the prior slice |
| Missing `{product_root}` / `{version_san}` / roadmap | Ask **once**, then proceed |
| P0 finding in `code-review-report.md` without waiver | Stop before `_done/` move |
| Human waiver needed (menu apply, `_done/` move) | Stop for that item only |

## Forbidden

- Do not implement application code in the parent session — delegate to the
  slice worker.
- Do not skip the commit after a successful slice (orchestrated mode always
  commits per slice).
- Do not generate new task files (planning is closed by the time you run).
- Do not access other products in the repo.
- Do not apply navigation semantic grouping without human approval.
- Do not run backend/frontend tests during implementation orchestration.

## Invocation examples

```
Product: apps/my-product/
Version: 3.8.0-feat-payable-payment-workflow
Agent: execution-orchestrator
Run all slices of the roadmap in orchestrated mode (sync subagent per slice,
commit per slice).
```

```
Orchestrate the partitioned implementation of apps/my-product 3.8.0.
```
