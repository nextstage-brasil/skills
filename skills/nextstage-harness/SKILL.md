# NextStage Harness

Shared reference documents for NextStage skills. Consumer skills point here for path resolution and planning gates — workflow logic stays in those skills.

## References

| File | When to read |
|------|--------------|
| `references/harness-discovery.md` | Resolving `{product_root}`, `{harness}`, rules paths, or MCP GitLab pointers |
| `references/artifact-layout.md` | SDD artifact paths under `docs/versions/`, living specs, handoff rules |
| `references/gates.md` | Human confirmation gates before requirements, scope, or task generation |

Read only the file(s) the active consumer skill names. Do not assume monorepo layout or stack unless discovery resolves it.
